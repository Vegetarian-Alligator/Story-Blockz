((Because this is being adapted from an earlier (but fully functional) project that was kept private, not all features are working))
Rational for this program

Story-Blockz is an visual programming langauge optimized for hypertext fiction.  This means that you can make a game and turn it into a webpage!  It is optimized to publish your hypertext in a book like format, with fixed (but interactive!) illustrations.  You can draw almost anything you want While you may need your own image editor (try www.gimp.org) this supports arbitrary page layouts and will keep your webpage from getting squished as you move across different screens, and let your story bloom to different sizes!

It will do all this for you with a handle visual editor, and even non-programmers can easily create linear stories if they have the illustrations they want - or, of course, without illustrations!

Because the output engine currently (only) supports HTML/Javascript/CSS, your story will be extremely portable.  All web features used by Story-Blockz are 5 years or older, so even many older computers will be able to play your game.

Of course, Story-Blockz supports a turing-complete suite of logical features, so your games can include complicated puzzles (although it would help if you are already a programmer to use these features to their maximum extent.)  It also supports embedded videos!

Most alternative ways of making the same stories into a web page seem more complicated to the author. It is suprisingly difficult to find commercial software that replicates the convienence of this project for it's intended use.



Adobe PDF requires sophisticated viewers that are less portable than this outpout.  Furthermore, you would have either full-on cudoing - it might even be worse than writing it in another common langauge - and without this, your story will look like a typical adobe PDF.  Also, to do this full-on coding, you will find it far easier with commercial software.  This is free.
